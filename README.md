# new-VBA-challenge



We used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. We analyzed 2014, 2015, and 2016 stock market data by utilizing VBA. 

We were asked to: 

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

        -The ticker symbol.
        -Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
        -The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
        -The total stock volume of the stock.
        
        
 We were then asked to provide screenshots on 2014, 2015, and 2016 stock market data after we completed the script. 
 
 The following screenshots are for stock data pertaining to 2014-2016.
